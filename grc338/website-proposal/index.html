            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Established in 2016, Roast is a haven for coffee lovers. Our first batch of beans was personally picked up in Uraguay by our founder, lovingly known as &lsquo;Uncle Jack&rsquo; in his 1969 red Ford pickup. Our commitment to curating, roasing, and brewing the best cup of coffee is the reason customers return, time and time again. We can't wait for you to make your home here at Roast.</p>
